# Udacity-Finding-Donors-Project
# Introduction:
This project is part of Udacity's Machine Learning Basic Nanodegree Program and I would like to share it in this repository. The main project goal is to assist CharityML (a hypothetical charitable organisation), accordingly I utilized supervised learning models on the collected data for the US census to help them predict the potential personnel whom are most likely to donate. 
# Project Overview:
In order to assist CharityML, I utilized supervised learning models on the collected data for the US census to help them predict the potential personnel whom are most likely to donate. To understand how the census data is recorded, I thoroughly explored the data then performed a number of transformation and preprocessing to prepare the training dataset. The data are then used to train three different supervised learning algorithms to test their performance against a naive predictor as a benchmark. After choosing the best performing algorithm, further fine tuning for the chosen algorithm hyper parameters has been performed in order to reach the best prediction outcome.
